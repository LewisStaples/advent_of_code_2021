Re-thinking the Day 23 problem

Read data file into data structure representing the initial burrow state
Loop through a fraction of the available moves, which will be children of initial burrow state
(1) Send an amphipod from origin sideroom directly to destination sideroom
(2) Send an amphipod from the hallway directly to destination sideroom
(3) Send an amphipod from a sideroom to a hallway location

Prevent burrow states from being represented more than once by having a list of pointers to all such states

Each time a burrow state is rediscovered, compare energies and (if needed) adjust it in the tree and all of its branches

I need to design an input file that tests adjusting energies in all branches, preferably near completion, so the results can be traced.
