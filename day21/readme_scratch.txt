The given number of game counts is too large to play out every game to the end!

Instead start by considering what happens if the score at the start of a round is 20 and that player is at any of the spaces 1-10.  Then consider a starting score of 19.  Therefore, the table will have 210 entries.

NO ... the table will have 210^2 = 44,100 entries to support starting score and starting space for both players

Given starting score 0-20, and given starting space 1-10, how many wins go for to starting player and the other player?

Data Structure is dict with index named tuple
	first_player_space
	first_player_score
	second_player_space
	second_player_score
